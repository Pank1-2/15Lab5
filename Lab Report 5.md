# CSE 15l Lab Report 5 - Kiko Pan 

In this lab report, I will be creating a debugging scenario as if it was a discussion post on EdStem. 

## Part 1: Student Post

**Title:** Need help fixing bug in ListExamples file of lab 7

**Category:** Debugging

**What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)**

I am editing the lab7 file that I have cloned into ieng6 server that I opened using VSCode terminal.  

**Detail the symptom you're seeing. Be specific; include both what you're seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn't work”.**



**Detail the failure-inducing input and context. That might mean any or all of the command you're running, a test case, command-line arguments, working directory, even the last few commands you ran. Do your best to provide as much context as you can.**
